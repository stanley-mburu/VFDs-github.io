            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>VFDs are essential components in controlling the frequency and voltage of an electric motor's power source, enabling speed adjustment and soft starting or stopping of the motor.</p>

            <h2>Selecting the Right VFD</h2>
            <p>When selecting the right VFD for a specific application, considerations include motor power rating, voltage tolerance, and NEMA MG1 standards for motor design.</p>

        <section id="sizing">
            <h2>VFD Sizing</h2>
            <p>In VFD sizing, the main considerations are the VFD's continuous current, which should be higher than the motor's maximum load current, and the intermittent current, which should be 115% greater than the motor current rating for variable torque applications and 150-200% for constant torque applications.</p>
